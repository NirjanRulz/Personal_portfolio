            <p>I am a Web Developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript.
                I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well. Iâ€™m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me
                to
                learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the
                state of
                the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand.</p>
